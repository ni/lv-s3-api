<h1>LabVIEW Interface for Amazon S3 </h1>
<strong>Installed With:</strong> VI Package Manager
<h2>About Amazon S3</h2>
<p>Amazon S3 is cloud-based storage for the Internet. It provides
an interface to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time,
from anywhere on the web.&nbsp;It gives any developer access to the
same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive
infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web
sites.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the Amazon S3 service, please
visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon
Simple Storage Service page</a>. A brief excerpt from that page
is presented below:</p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Data stored in Amazon S3 is secure by default; only bucket and
object owners have access to the Amazon S3 resources they create. For
customers who must comply with regulatory standards such as PCI and
HIPAA, Amazon S3&#8217;s data protection features can be used as part of an
overall strategy to achieve compliance.</p>
<h3>Data Durability and Reliability</h3>
<p>Amazon S3 provides a highly durable storage infrastructure
designed for mission-critical and primary data storage. Objects are
redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple facilities in an
Amazon S3 Region. To help ensure durability, Amazon S3 PUT and COPY
operations synchronously store your data across multiple facilities
before returning SUCCESS. Once stored, Amazon S3 maintains the
durability of your objects by quickly detecting and repairing any lost
redundancy.</p>
<p>Amazon S3&#8217;s standard storage is: </p>
<ul>
<li>Backed with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla">Amazon
S3 Service Level Agreement</a>.</li>
<li>Designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99%
availability of objects over a given year. </li>
<li>Designed to sustain the concurrent loss of data in two
facilities.</li>
</ul>
Amazon S3 provides further protection via Versioning. You can use
Versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every
object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. This allows you to easily
recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.
<h3>Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)</h3>
Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) is a storage option within Amazon S3
that enables customers to reduce their costs by storing non-critical,
reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3&#8217;s
standard storage. It provides a cost-effective, highly available
solution for distributing or sharing content that is durably stored
elsewhere, or for storing thumbnails, transcoded media, or other
processed data that can be easily reproduced. Reduced Redundancy
Storage is:
<ul>
<li>Backed with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla">Amazon
S3 Service Level Agreement</a>.</li>
<li>Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99%
availability of objects over a given year. This durability level
corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. </li>
<li>Designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon S3 Concepts</h3>
<h4>Buckets</h4>
A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object
is contained in a bucket. For example, if the object named
photos/puppy.jpg is stored in the johnsmith bucket, then it is
addressable using the URL
http://johnsmith.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg<br>
Buckets serve several purposes: they organize the Amazon S3 namespace
at the highest level, they identify the account responsible for storage
and data transfer charges, they play a role in access control, and they
serve as the unit of aggregation for usage reporting.
<br>
You can configure buckets so that they are created in a specific
Region. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/LocationSelection.html">Buckets
and Regions</a>. You can also configure a bucket so that every
time an object is added to it, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID
and assigns it to the object. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html">Versioning</a>.<br>
For more information about buckets, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html">Working
with Amazon S3 Buckets</a>.
<h4>Objects</h4>
Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects
consist of object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to
Amazon S3. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the
object. These include some default metadata such as the date last
modified, and standard HTTP metadata such as Content-Type. The
developer can also specify custom metadata at the time the Object is
stored.<br>
An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a
version ID. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#BasicsKeys">Keys</a>
and <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html">Versioning</a>.
<h4>Keys</h4>
A&nbsp;key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket.
Every
object in a bucket has exactly one key. Because the combination of a
bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identify each object, Amazon S3
can be thought of as a basic data map between "bucket + key + version"
and the object itself. Every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely
addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint, bucket
name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL
http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl, "doc" is the name
of the bucket and "2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl" is the key.<br>
<h4>Regions</h4>
You can choose the geographical Region where Amazon S3 will store the
buckets you create. You might choose a Region to optimize latency,
minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.
