<h1>LabVIEW Interface for Amazon S3 </h1>
<strong>Installed With:</strong> VI Package Manager
<h2>Getting Started with LabVIEW Interface for Amazon S3</h2>
<ol>
<h3><li>Registering for Amazon S3</li>
</h3>
<p>The first step to use this toolkit is to register an AWS
account at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon
Web Services portal</a>.</p>
<p>After registration has been completed, you will be notified
by
e-mail.</p>
<h3><li>AWS Account Security Credentials</li>
</h3>
<p>When you create an AWS Account, AWS assigns the following
credentials to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Key ID (a 20-character, alphanumeric string). For
example: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</li>
<li>Secret Access Key (a 40-character string). For example:
wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY</li>
</ul>
The Access Key ID uniquely identifies an AWS Account. You
can use these AWS Account credentials to send authenticated requests to
Amazon S3. You will need these Security Credentials while using this
toolkit.<br>
Your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are displayed when you create
your AWS account. They are not e-mailed to you. If you need to see them
again, you can view them at any time from your AWS account.<br>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Amazon Web Services web site at
http://aws.amazon.com.</li>
<li>Click the Account tab.</li>
<li>Click Security Credentials.</li>
</ul>
If you have not already signed in, Sign In or Create an AWS Account
page displays. You must sign in before you can see your AWS account
security credentials.
Your access credentials, Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, are
displayed on the resulting Security Credentials page.
<h3><li>Using toolkit VIs</li>
</h3>
<h4>Using Examples</h4>
This toolkit comes with some example applications that demonstrate the
usage of the API elements.<br>
You can locate these examples using NI Example Finder (located under
Help -&gt; Find Examples...) by searching for the keyword "s3" or
browsing the Examples tree (Networking -&gt; Internet &amp;
Web).
<h4>Creating you own Application</h4>
<p>You can find the API functions on the "Functions -&gt;
Addons -&gt; LabVIEW Interface for Amazon S3" palette.</p>
<p>To start using S3, first you have to store your Security
credentials in
the toolkit's global credential store within your application. Use the
"Set AWS Credentials.vi"
to set and store your credentials.
(For security purposes there is no way to read out the credentials from
the
store.) You only need to store the credentials once, before calling any
S3 API calls.</p>
<p>After storing your credentials, you can use other S3
functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can list the buckets owned by you using the "List
Buckets" function.</li>
<li>Operations with/on buckets are found under the "Bucket
Operations" subpalette.</li>
<li>Operations with/on objects are found under the "Object
Operations" subpalette.</li>
<li>If you are working with large objects, you can use the
Multipart upload functions under the "Object Operations -&gt;
Advanced Object Operations -&gt; Multipart Upload" subpalette.
These functions provide you with the ability to upload your data in
smaller chunks.</li>
<li>Functions on the "Low-Level" subpalette allows you to
implement Amazon S3 API calls that are not implemented in this toolkit.
Thes VIs are also used by the higher level functions of this toolkit.</li>
</ul>
